      "assistant": "## Overview of Fertility Health\n\nFertility health refers to the ability of individuals to conceive children. It is a critical aspect of reproductive health, which encompasses the condition of male and female reproductive systems throughout all life stages[DOC 5]. Fertility issues can arise from various factors, including age, lifestyle choices, and medical conditions, affecting both men and women[DOC 2].\n\n### Key Aspects of Fertility Health\n\n1. **Definition and Prevalence**: Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after at least one year of unprotected sex. Approximately 10â€“15% of couples experience infertility, with challenges increasing with age[DOC 2].\n\n2. **Causes and Factors**: In women, common causes include problems with ovarian function, obstructed fallopian tubes, and uterine abnormalities. In men, issues often relate to disrupted testicular or ejaculatory function[1]. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol use, and certain medications can also impact fertility[1].\n\n3. **Workplace Considerations**: Supporting fertility health in the workplace is crucial for employee well-being and productivity. Companies can offer benefits like flexible leave policies and fertility treatments to support employees facing reproductive challenges[DOC 3][DOC 4].\n\n4. **Importance of Inclusive Policies**: Reproductive health is not solely a women's issue; it affects both men and women and impacts workplace dynamics. Inclusive policies can help reduce stigma and improve employee engagement[DOC 2][DOC 3].\n\n### Primary Sources Used\n\n- **[DOC 1]**: Measuring Impact and Tracking Success\n- **[DOC 2]**: Importance of Health Insurance and Reproductive Health\n- **[DOC 3]**: Supporting Employees with Reproductive and Fertility Challenges\n- **[DOC 4]**: Case Study on Supporting Reproductive Health\n- **[DOC 5]**: Downloadable Resources for Reproductive Health\n\nExternal sources:\n- **[1]**: Fertility and Reproductive Health | Johns Hopkins Medicine\n- **[2]**: Understanding Fertility: The Basics | HHS Office of Population Affairs\n- **[3]**: Infertility: Types, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis & Treatment | Cleveland Clinic\n- **[4]**: Infertility - World Health Organization (WHO)\n- **[5]**: Repproductive Health | NIEHS NIH"
