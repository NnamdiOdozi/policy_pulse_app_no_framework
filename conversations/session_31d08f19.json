      "assistant": "Peer support plays a crucial role in reproductive health by providing emotional, psychological, and practical assistance to individuals facing reproductive health challenges. Its importance can be summarized as follows:\n\n### 1. Reduces Isolation and Enhances Mental Wellbeing\nPeer support groups create a safe, collaborative environment where individuals can share their experiences and challenges related to reproductive health, such as fertility issues or pregnancy-related mental health difficulties. This shared experience helps reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation, which are common during such journeys, and promotes mental wellbeing by fostering confidence and emotional resilience[DOC 5][3].\n\n### 2. Improves Access to and Engagement with Support Services\nPeer support acts as an adjunct or complement to formal healthcare by encouraging individuals to seek and continue with professional mental health or reproductive health treatments. It can increase outreach to populations that might otherwise have poor engagement with formal services, making support more scalable and accessible[3].\n\n### 3. Provides Practical Guidance and Shared Knowledge\nThrough peer discussions, individuals gain insights into managing workplace challenges related to reproductive health, such as how to communicate with managers or balance treatment with work responsibilities. This exchange of knowledge empowers employees to navigate their reproductive health journeys more effectively[DOC 5].\n\n### 4. Boosts Workplace Productivity and Inclusion\nSupporting reproductive health through peer networks helps employees manage symptoms and challenges that might otherwise reduce concentration and productivity. For example, menopausal symptoms and menstrual pain can significantly impact work performance. Peer support contributes to a more inclusive workplace culture by addressing these needs openly, which in turn helps attract and retain diverse talent[1].\n\n### 5. Builds Trust and Community\nPeer support fosters relationships based on trust and shared experience, creating a supportive community that can advocate for better reproductive health policies and cultural change within organizations[DOC 5].\n\n---\n\n### Summary\nPeer support in reproductive health is vital for reducing isolation, improving mental health outcomes, enhancing engagement with formal support, providing practical workplace guidance, and fostering inclusive, productive work environments. It complements clinical care and plays a key role in holistic reproductive health support.\n\n---\n\n### Sources\n- Fertility Network UK: Peer to Peer Support for Women in the Workplace [DOC 5]\n- PMC Article on Peer Support and Perinatal Mental Health [3]\n- Fertifa on Workplace Reproductive Health Benefits [1]"

      "assistant": "If the `search_domain_filter` parameter in a Sonar API call is provided as an empty list, the behavior is not explicitly documented in the search results. However, based on the general usage of the `search_domain_filter` parameter, which controls inclusion or exclusion of domains in search results, an empty list would logically mean **no domain filtering is applied**—i.e., the search will include results from all domains without restriction[3].\n\nThis interpretation aligns with typical API design patterns where:\n\n- Providing a non-empty list restricts results to those domains (allowlist) or excludes certain domains (denylist).\n- Providing an empty list means no filtering criteria are set, so the API returns results from the full set of available domains.\n\nNo direct error or empty result behavior is indicated for an empty list filter in the provided documentation or community discussions.\n\n### Summary\n- An empty `search_domain_filter` list likely results in no domain filtering, returning results from all domains.\n- This is consistent with the parameter’s purpose to limit or exclude domains when specified.\n- No evidence suggests that an empty list causes errors or empty results.\n\n---\n\n### Source\n- Explanation of `search_domain_filter` usage and examples from Perplexity API guide [3]."
